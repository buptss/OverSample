Random Oversample: 

# Evaluation Principle
Precision: The precision is the ratio tp / (tp + fp) where tp is the number of true positives and fp the number of false positives. 

Recall: The recall is the ratio tp / (tp + fn) where tp is the number of true positives and fn the number of false negatives.

G-mean: The geometric mean (G-mean) is the root of the product of class-wise sensitivity. 
For binary classification G-mean is the squared root of the product of the sensitivity and specificity.

F1-score: F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
